# Indoor Positioning

The thing right now is we can't use the GPS indoor or the Apple AR kit because it's impossible for us the get or make and store the whole building's data and we don't plan to use a mobile device at the first place.



But after seeing how the AR works for indoor navigation, this give inspiration for how to achieve the navigation:



We can manually set the anchors for navigation, instead of writing the algorithm to find the path, we write the path manually and step by step, from one anchor to another and lead us to the destination we want to go. 



eg. We enter the MVB from the main entrance and we want to go to the hack space, suppose we have two anchors, one is at the Welcoming desk and the other is at the end of the stairs from ground floor to the lower ground floor. When we reach the welcoming desk, we tap the card with the card reader(Maybe RFID?) and it will tell you "Walk straight if you see the stair and go down", then you tap card with the card reader at the end of the stair and it will tell you "Walk straight to the end and turn right".



The problem of this idea is that it's not called navigation but more like we set the destinations and we want the people to follow the route we have already designed. Also we need to make different route for  different starting points and destinations which would be messy.



But this will draw a different question about how to change the temperature. I have no idea about what to do with this right now but I guess we can figure it out later.
